# Application Layer Instructions
# The Application Layer is responsible for handling the business logic of the application. It should contain services, commands, queries, and any other components that are necessary to implement the application's use cases. The Application Layer should be designed to be independent of any specific UI or data access technology, allowing it to be easily tested and maintained.
